# Filtered searches on a Book Sales database
In this project, I used a dataset containing NY Times newspaper published "best seller" lists since 1942. These lists are created based on nationwide sales, and fields include title, author, publisher, category (fiction or nonfiction), and the date each title first reached #1 on one of the best seller lists.

This program displays a menu of options, allowing the user to search for books that meet a certain criteria.
You will design, implement and test a program that allows the user to search a subset of the books that
have appeared in the New York Times bestseller lists. For simplicity, the data set will only contain
those books that have reached #1 on either of two lists (fiction and nonfiction) since 1942.

The menu options are:
1. Display all books in a year range
2. Display all books in a specific month and year
3. Search for an author
4. Search for a title

The program will input the data set and construct a list of books. If the list of books cannot be
constructed, the program will display an appropriate error message and halt.
